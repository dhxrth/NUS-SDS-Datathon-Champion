The data set, catA_train.csv, contains the data collected from 29182 companies.  The method of data collection is unknown.

The purpose of this model is to identify sales trends using the different features presented in the dataset. Classifiers such as logistic regression model, decision trees and K-nearest neighbours will be used in the model. Their goodness of fit will also be evaluated. R code used for data interpretation, classifier construction and evaluation can be found in the R file attached along with the report. The set.seed() will be set to set.seed(146) for all operations in this model.
