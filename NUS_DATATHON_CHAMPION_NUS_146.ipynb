        "#### The association between the response variables and quantitative input variables were determined using correlation values. The correlation values between the response variable \"Domestic Ultimate Sales\" and \"Age\" were tabulated to be -0.0165515 which indicates a weak negative correlation. Since \"Global Ultimate Sales\" and \"Domestic Ultimate Sales\" are key response variables, the rows with NA were removed as well. The correlation values between the response variable \"Domestic Ultimate Sales\" and \"Domestic Ultimate Employees\" were tabulated to be 0.01638367 which indicates a weak positive correlation. The correlation values between the response variable \"Global Ultimate Sales\" and \"Global Ultimate Employees\" were tabulated to be 0.6634766 which indicates a strong positive correlation.\n",

        "#### The association between categorical input variables and the response variables were identified using boxplots and the respective means. The mean (means1) Domestic Ultimate Sales was higher by 7.873727 times when the company is not the ultimate or highest-level company within a corporate structure based in its home country (Is Domestic Ultimate = 0). The mean Global Ultimate Sales (means2) was higher by 13.37533 times when Is Global Ultimate = 0. When comparing mean Global Ultimate Sales (means3) and a companies import/export status, companies that do both import and export recorded the highest mean sales. When comparing the industry of a company and their mean Global Ultimate Sales (means4), the top 5 industries were Petroleum Refining, Air Courier Services, Miscellaneous Business Credit Institutions, Plastics Bottles, Television Broadcasting Stations. When comparing the entity type of a company and their mean Global Ultimate Sales (means5), independently owned companies were ranked the highest. When comparing the parent country of a company and their mean Global Ultimate Sales (means6), the top 5 countries were Finland, Mexico, Bahamas, Ireland and Switzerland. When comparing the ownership type of a company and their mean Global Ultimate Sales (means7), privately owned companies were ranked the highest. When comparing the Global Ultimate Country of a company and their mean Global Ultimate Sales (means8), the top 5 countries were Mexico, United States, Japan, Germany and Taiwan."
